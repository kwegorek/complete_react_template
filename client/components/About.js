          In my teenage years I fell in love with sailing. After a trip through
          a famous lake near my hometown I eagerly gained a skipper license
          thereafter. I sailed in Europe, both lakes and seas. My favorite
          excursion was a 7-day trip between Croatian islands where I spent each
          night on a different island. My next adventure will be to sail through
          the Caribbean and Thailand islands

          I am proud of myself for juggling the hectic and rewarding benefits of
          being a mom to my 2 year old baby, in addition to simultaneously
          attending and graduating the Grace Hopper Program. After graduating
          The Grace Hopper Program I feel empowered and inspired to create an
          environment where others can flourish and collaborate positively to
          achieve their goals.{' '}
